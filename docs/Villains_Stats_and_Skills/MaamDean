## Phase 1: Dean’s Summoning (Instructor Trials)

**Description:**  
Ma’am Dean starts by calling forth the instructors from previous stages. Each instructor represents a different discipline — Logic, Coding, Strategy, or Analysis.  
The Dean observes and empowers them, gradually testing the player’s endurance and adaptability.

**Starting HP:** 800  

**Mechanics:**
- Every 2 turns, Dean summons one Instructor from the Instructor File.  
- Each active Instructor grants Dean:
  - +15 Wisdom regeneration  
  - +5% Logic (Attack Power)  
- Instructors must be defeated before damage can be dealt to the Dean.  
- After 3–4 Instructors are defeated, Dean transitions to her Awakened Form, restoring her full HP.

**Transition Dialogue:**  
> *“You have bested my mentors... but can you withstand the source of all exams?”*
