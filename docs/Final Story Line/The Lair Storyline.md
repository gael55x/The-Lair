#The Lair

In a world where magic is written in code and power is measured in logic, there stands the grand citadel of learning known as the <strong>Cebu Institute of Technology University</strong>.

To the outside world, it is a school, but to those who walk its halls, it is a proving ground for the next generation of digital pioneers.

A new student arrives, fresh from high school, ready to master the arcane arts of Information Technology and earn a degree. But this is no ordinary education. The path to graduation is a legendary questâ€”a journey through seven great trials. Each trial is overseen by a formidable instructor, guardians of knowledge who test only the worthy.

To succeed, one must journey through realms of programming, conquer challenges of data, and command the very foundations of technology itself.

The greatest tests lie not in simple exams, but in battles of wit and creativity against the masters.

The first trial awaits. The quest for knowledge begins now
