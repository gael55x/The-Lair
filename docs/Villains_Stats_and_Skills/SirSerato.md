## Sir Serato — *The Guardian of Data*

*(Debugging and DSA)*

* **HP:** 700<br>
* **Logic (Attack Power):** 500<br>
* **Wisdom (Mana):** 350

## Role in The Lair

* **Second Trial Guardian** — Once a compiler spirit devoted to pure order, Sir Serato’s obsession with perfection corrupted his code. He became a self-replicating anomaly, twisting logic trees and fragmenting arrays into chaos. Adventurers face him to prove mastery over recursion, debugging, and algorithmic discipline.
* **Theme:** Debugging Nightmares — corrupted stacks, leaking heaps, and loops without end.
* **Battle Style:** Precision-breaking; each attack destabilizes the player’s logic until the entire system risks collapse.

## Skills

* **Segfault Strike**
* **Cost:** 50 Wisdom
* **Effect:** Unleashes a precision crash that deals Logic × 1.2 (600 base) damage.
* **Mechanic:** Ignores armor but risks self-damage if Serato’s logic flow isn’t aligned.
* **Puzzle Twist:** Players must detect and “patch” the fault location or lose their next turn to a critical crash.
* **Cooldown:** 4 turns.

* **Infinite Loop(Ultimate)**
* **Cost:** 120 Wisdom
* **Effect:** Traps the opponent in an endless execution cycle, inflicting 100 damage per turn until a logical “break” is found.
* **Mechanic:** Each failed attempt to escape restarts the loop, resetting all cooldowns.
* **Puzzle Twist:** Players must identify the loop’s condition and disrupt it with precise timing.
* **Cooldown:** 6 turns.

## Battle Flow
* Begins with Segfault Strike to test defensive logic and resilience.
* Corrupts the field with Garbage Overflow, forcing players into resource management chaos.
* Concludes with Infinite Loop, locking the arena into recursion until the player breaks free through flawless reasoning.
