## Sir Serato — *The Buglord Compiler*

*(Architect of Errors)*

**HP:** 700
**Logic (Attack Power):** 450
**Wisdom (Mana):** 300

### Role in The Lair

* **SecondTrial Guardian** — embodies the chaos of deeper programming errors that look “fine” until runtime.
* **Theme:** Debugging nightmares — crashes, recursion traps, memory leaks.
* **Battle Style:** Corrupts player flow with status effects, misdirection, and escalating “system failures.”

### Skills

**Segfault Strike**

* **Cost:** 50 Wisdom
* **Effect:** Deals Logic × 0.9 damage (400 base).
* **Debuff:** Randomly disables one player skill for 2 turns.
* **Puzzle Twist:** Player must solve with fewer available options until the block clears.
* **Cooldown:** 3 turns.

---

**Garbage Overflow**

* **Cost:** 60 Wisdom
* **Effect:** Deals Logic × 1.05 (420 base) and clogs the player’s Wisdom recovery.
* **Puzzle Twist:** Player’s Wisdom/Mana bar overfills — they must “collect garbage” or lose 10 Wisdom per turn.
* **Cooldown:** 4 turns.

---

**Infinite Loop**

* **Cost:** 80 Wisdom
* **Effect:** Deals 275 damage each turn until “debugged.”
* **Puzzle Twist:** Player is forced to repeat the same move until they debug a code (like a pattern-break or a hard to analyze errors).
* **Cooldown:** 5 turns.

### Battle Flow

* Starts with Segfault Strike to shut down player tools.
* Locks them into Infinite Loop mid-fight, draining patience.
* Uses Garbage Overflow to destabilize Wisdom management.
* When cornered, unleashes Regex Hex for maximum confusion.
