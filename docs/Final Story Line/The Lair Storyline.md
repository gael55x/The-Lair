#The Lair

In a world where magic is written in code and power is measured in logic, there stands the grand citadel of learning known as the <strong>Cebu Institute of Technology University</strong>.

To the outside world, it is a school, but to those who walk its halls, it is a proving ground for the next generation of digital pioneers.

A new student arrives, fresh from high school, ready to master the arcane arts of Information Technology and earn a degree. But this is no ordinary education. The path to graduation is a legendary quest—a journey through seven great trials. Each trial is overseen by a formidable instructor, guardians of knowledge who test only the worthy.

To succeed, one must journey through realms of programming, conquer challenges of data, and command the very foundations of technology itself.

The greatest tests lie not in simple exams, but in battles of wit and creativity against the masters.

The first trial awaits. The quest for knowledge begins now.....

<b>Stage 1 – The Hall of Flame (Ma’am Cathy)</b>

You enter the first chamber. Torches roar to life, painting the walls in fiery light. The air burns with heat.

At the far end stands Ma’am Cathy, her gaze sharp and unwavering.

<b>MA’AM CATHY (calling out):</b>
“You dare to begin the trials? Then prove you can withstand the fire. Defeat my students first — only then may you face me.”

From the flames, minions rise:
<b>(start minion fight)</b>

<b>(when all minion defeated)</b>
The last ember fades. Ma’am Cathy steps forward, staff glowing like molten steel.

<b>MA’AM CATHY:</b>
“You’ve survived the sparks, but I am the true flame. Let us see if your resolve burns brighter than mine.”

<b>(Boss fight begins.)</b>

<b>(Boss defeated)</b>
Boss Epilogue:
Ma’am Cathy lowers her staff, the fire around you dimming. She studies you with a firm but approving look.

<b>MA’AM CATHY:</b>
“You did not falter. Good. You’ve proven your resolve burns bright. Carry this spark with you — you will need it for what lies ahead.”
