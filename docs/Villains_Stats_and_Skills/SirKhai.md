Sir Khai — The Object-Oriented Sentinel
(Warden of Encapsulation and Order)

HP: 900
Discipline (Attack Power): 480
Comprehension (Mana): 400

Role in The Lair

Second Chamber Guardian — The OOP Enforcer
Once a revered mentor of balance and design, Sir Khai now guards the Hall of Order, where every class, object, and method must follow his rigid laws. His mind is a perfect blueprint of structure — inheritance flows like blood, encapsulation seals his core, and polymorphism defines his strikes.

To pass him, challengers must prove they understand not just how code runs — but why it’s designed that way.

Theme: Order through Abstraction — code constructs materialize into spectral knights, protected behind walls of access modifiers.

Battle Style: Methodical and layered; Sir Khai adapts his stance using OOP principles, forcing players to apply abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation logic mid-battle.

Skills
1. Encapsulation Barrier

Cost: 50 Comprehension
Effect: Reduces all incoming damage by 40% for 3 turns.

Mechanic: While active, Sir Khai becomes immune to “direct variable access” — certain attacks fail unless the player uses “getter/setter”-type moves.

Puzzle Twist: Player must use the correct method to interact with him (e.g., “access through function” rather than “direct hit”).

Cooldown: 3 turns

2. Inheritance Strike

Cost: 60 Comprehension
Effect: Discipline × 1.2 (576 base) damage.

Mechanic: Copies (“inherits”) the player’s last used ability and strengthens it by 20%.

Puzzle Twist: Player must “override” the copied move by using a different logic pattern — repeating the same attack results in counter damage.

Cooldown: 4 turns

3. Polymorphic Mirage

Cost: 75 Comprehension
Effect: Summons 3 phantom versions of Sir Khai. Only one is the true instance; the rest are “overloaded” illusions.

Puzzle Twist: Player must determine which “object instance” is real based on behavior (each clone uses different method patterns).

Wrong target: Player loses 80 HP due to “runtime confusion.”

Cooldown: 5 turns

4. Access Modifier Judgment

Cost: 65 Comprehension
Effect: Deals Discipline × 1.0 (480 base).

Mechanic: The move changes based on the “visibility state” of the player:

Public: Normal damage.

Protected: Reduced damage but applies a Defense Debuff.

Private: Massive damage (Discipline × 1.5) — “violating encapsulation.”

Puzzle Twist: Player must choose the right “visibility mode” before the attack lands.

Cooldown: 3 turns

5. Abstract Punishment (Ultimate)

Cost: 120 Comprehension
Effect: Creates an “Abstract Arena” — all player skills lose concrete effects for 2 turns.

Mechanic: The player’s abilities become “undefined” until they implement proper “concrete classes” (by solving short logic cues or command puzzles).

Puzzle Twist: Player must “implement” missing logic before next turn or lose 100 HP per missed method.

Cooldown: 6 turns

Battle Flow

Opening Move: Encapsulation Barrier — to test if players can “access” him correctly.

Phase 1: Uses Inheritance Strike to reflect and enhance player tactics.

Phase 2: Shifts into Polymorphic Mirage, forcing players to identify true logic paths.

Phase 3: Judges “visibility discipline” with Access Modifier Judgment, punishing reckless exposure.

Final Phase: Casts Abstract Punishment — the battlefield turns white and empty, only those who understand OOP design can “instantiate” victory.

Quote:

“Order is not restriction — it is understanding. Code without structure is chaos. And chaos… has no access here.”
